Welcome to subsymbolic, home to Mia Alexiou's projects, ideas and ruminations.

I am a freelance software engineer, specialising in mobile, iOS and Android. I have built numerous applications, large and small, including helping launch Duck Duck Goâ€™s mobile browsers and privacy tools. I am currently directing my attention to my long-standing passions of psychology, health and data science. **We are living through a great mental health crisis, people are struggling. I want to understand why and what we need to change to foster healthier, happier communities.**

I'm an avid volunteer. I love travelling and getting immersed in humanity, almost as much as fleeing it and escaping into nature. I enjoy hiking, cycling and swimming but am especially running-obsessed - there is nothing I  love more than a day on the trails.

**I need physical activity to _be_ well. Perhaps we all do.**
